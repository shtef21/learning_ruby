3. Difficult Assignment: Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Two-Player)
Problem: Write a command-line Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. The game should allow two players to take turns inputting their moves and display the board after each move. The game ends when either a player wins or the board is full (resulting in a draw).

Requirements:

The program should print the board after each move.

Players should take turns, with player 1 using 'X' and player 2 using 'O'.

The program should check for a win or draw after each move.

The game should ask if players want to play again after a win, draw, or when the game ends.

Example:
