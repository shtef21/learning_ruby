1. Easy Assignment: Sum of Odd Numbers
Problem: Write a program that takes a positive integer n as input and outputs the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and n (inclusive).

Requirements:

The program should prompt the user to enter a number n.

If the input is invalid (e.g., a negative number or non-numeric input), the program should handle it gracefully.

Output the sum of all odd numbers between 1 and n.

Example:

Input: 10

Output: 25 (since 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 = 25)
